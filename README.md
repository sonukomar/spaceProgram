# Space Program
Project created using create-react-app and after development of the components, project is ejected using npm run eject and
modified configuration to support other configs. 

For server side rendering I have installed express and using node server to serve the files as well as the static contents.
first i have created the build folder using npm run buld and the content is served for that location.

For hosting the app on heroku, i added Procfile and connected my git repo to it with automatic deployment enabled. So if i push any code it will 
automatically deploy my code.
